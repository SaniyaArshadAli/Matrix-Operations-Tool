# Matrix-Operations-Tool
Matrix Operations Tool
This is a web-based tool built with Streamlit and NumPy that allows users to perform common matrix operations through an interactive and user-friendly interface.
Features
Addition (+): Adds two matrices of the same dimensions.
Subtraction (-): Subtracts one matrix from another, provided they have the same dimensions.
Multiplication (Ã—): Multiplies two matrices, checking for compatibility.
Transpose (T): Transposes a single matrix.
Determinant: Calculates the determinant of a square matrix.
How to Use
Enter your matrices: In the "Matrix Operations" tab, you will see two text areas for "Matrix A" and "Matrix B." Enter your matrix elements here.
Separate elements in a row with a space.
Use a new line for each new row of the matrix.
For example, a 2times2 matrix with elements 1, 2, 3, 4 would be entered as:
1 2
3 4


Select an Operation: Click the button for the operation you want to perform (e.g., "Addition (+)").
View the Result: The calculated result will be displayed below the buttons. If there is an error (e.g., mismatched dimensions), an error message will appear.
Installation and Setup

Cheat Sheet
A dedicated "Cheat Sheet" tab is included in the application. It provides a quick reference for the rules and requirements of each matrix operation to help you avoid common errors.
